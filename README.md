# Zero Meetings Proof
> A new Blockchain Scalability Solution

## Abstract
**Zero Meetings Proof** or **ZMP** is a revolutionary off-chain scaling mechanism that lets core blockchain developers focus on shipping code instead of going into f*cking one-on-one coffee meetings every day. Period.

## 1. Mechanism
ZMP technology is *compatible* with all existing and non-yet-existing blockchains and can be easily integrated (your mileage may vary).
In order to successfully integrate ZMP in your project, you will require
1. a project that is gaining enough traction for people to be willing to invite you or your engineers to "grab a coffee and chat"
1. a few competent engineers, that are already working on scalability problems
1. willpower to say "NO"
